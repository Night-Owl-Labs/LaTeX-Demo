# LaTeX Demo: Professional Document Formatting
This repository contains an example `LaTeX` document that demonstrates the capabilities of `LaTeX` for creating professional-quality documents with mathematical and scientific content.

## About LaTeX
`LaTeX` is a typesetting system built on top of the `TeX` typesetting system. It is widely used for producing documents with consistent and high-quality formatting, particularly in academic, research, and technical contexts. `LaTeX` excels at typesetting complex mathematical equations, scientific symbols, and structured documents.

## Example Contents
The `LaTeX` document (`demo.tex`) in this repository showcases various features of `LaTeX`:

## Structured sections and headings
- Mathematical equations using the amsmath package
- Inclusion of figures using the graphicx package
- Lists and itemization
- Cross-referencing sections, figures, and equations
- Proper citation management using BibTeX
- Compiling the Document
- To compile the `LaTeX` document into a `PDF`, you'll need a `LaTeX` distribution installed on your system (such as `TeX Live` or `MiKTeX`). Use a `LaTeX` compiler, such as `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, or `lualatex`, to compile the document:

```sh
pdflatex demo.tex
```

The compilation process may require running the compiler multiple times to resolve cross-references and citations.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Compile the `LaTeX` document using the appropriate compiler command.
4. The compiled PDF output (`demo.pdf`) will be generated.
